```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

set.seed(123) # Set random number generation

m <- lm(mpg ~ hp + cyl + drat, mtcars)

l <- list(a = list(m = matrix(1:12, ncol = 3),
                   v = 1:7),
          b = data.frame(student = 1:15,
                         score = rnorm(15, 100, 10)))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
